# OCR and Text Search App

This repository contains a Streamlit-based application that performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on uploaded images and enables users to search and highlight specific text within the extracted results.

---

## Features
- **OCR**: Extracts text from uploaded images using the `ucaslcl/GOT-OCR2_0` model.
- **Search**: Allows users to search for specific terms in the OCR results, highlighting matches.
- **Interactive UI**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for image uploading, OCR processing, and text search.
- **Dynamic Text Highlighting**: Highlights search terms in the OCR results using a distinct color.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Access to the Hugging Face model repository with a valid authentication token

### Steps to Install
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ocr-text-search-app.git
   cd ocr-text-search-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Your Hugging Face Token**
   Replace `REPLACE_YOUR_HF_TOKEN` in the code with your Hugging Face API token. 
   If you don’t have one, create an account at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) and generate an API token.

4. **Run the App**
